Program created in C for one of my classes.
This program is a queue where the user can add patients to a list. There can only be 14 patients per day and each patient takes up
30 minutes. If the user wants to see a patient and delete it, there is an option for that. The user can also review which patients
are left for the day, or start a new day.
